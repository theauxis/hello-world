Learning how to use GitHub

This is just me learning to use GitHub as I learn how to code.
I have two different laptops located at two different residences of mine and I don't like carrying them around.
Because of this, I needed so sync the work in Comp1 to the work in Comp2 so that wherever I am, I can continue with my work.
So the master is Comp1 and Gateway is Comp2.
